# Tetris

Welcome to Tetris! This is a simple Tetris game clone written in Python using the Pygame library. It replicates the classic Tetris gameplay, allowing players to move, rotate, and  
drop Tetriminos while trying to clear lines and achieve a high score. I built this because I loved playing Tetris growing up and I wanted to challenge myself with making my first game. I 
hope you enjoy playing the game!

- Classic Tetris gameplay.

## How to Play

To play the Tetris game clone, follow these instructions:

1. **Movement**: Use the arrow keys to move the Tetriminos left, right, or down.
2. **Rotation**: Press the "Up" arrow key to rotate the currently falling Tetrimino.
3. **Clear Lines**: Your goal is to complete full horizontal lines with Tetriminos. When you do, those lines will clear, and you'll earn points.
4. **Game Over**: The game ends when the Tetriminos stack up to the top of the screen, and there's no more room for new pieces.

Try to achieve the highest score possible by strategically placing and clearing Tetriminos. Good luck!
